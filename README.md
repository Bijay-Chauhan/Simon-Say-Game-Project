# Simon-Say-Game-Project
Simon Says is a fun memory game. The computer (Simon) shows a sequence of colors or sounds — you must remember and repeat the same sequence in the correct order. Each round, the sequence gets longer and harder!

How to Play:
The game starts — one color flashes (for example, Red).
You click that same color.
Next round — Simon adds another color (for example, Red → Blue).
You must click Red, then Blue, in the same order.
Each time you get it right, the sequence gets longer.
If you click the wrong color, the game ends!
